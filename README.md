I have already learnt all the basics of html and css, and I am currently learning JS, but I am doing this course because I can see that it will help me learn git and github and also it will reecho some stuffs into mind. I like how the link to different resources that are rich of information.

By the end of this project I will learn:

- How to write good commit messages
- Know when to commit
- Have a fair idea about how git and github works
