                <h2>Origin, Looks and More About Yam Porridge</h2>
                <p>
                    Yam porridge, also known as mpotompoto, is a popular dish in West Africa, particularly in Nigeria and Ghana. The dish is
                    made with yam, cocoyam, or sweet potatoes and is typically cooked with a blend of peppers, tomatoes, onions, palm oil,
                    and seasoning. When finished, it is often served on its own alongside some fried ripe plantains or meat.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The origin of yam porridge is not clear. However, it is believed to have originated from the Yoruba-speaking parts of
                    Nigeria. The dish has since spread to other parts of West Africa and has become a staple in many households.

                <h3>Instructions</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>Peel and cut the yam into small pieces.</li>
                    <li>Rinse the yam thoroughly to remove any dirt.</li>
                    <li>
                        In a pot, add the yam, onions, tomatoes, garlic, tomato paste, and enough water to cover the ingredients.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Cover the pot and allow it to boil for about 30 minutes or until the yam is soft.
                    </li>
                    <li>Add the salt, black pepper, and curry powder.</li>
                    <li>
                        Mash the yam with a spatula to get a porridge consistency.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Add your boiled fish or meat.
                    </li>
                    <li>Put a different pan on heat and pour oil in it.</li>
                    <li>Add some chopped onions to the oil when it heated.</li>
                    <li>
                        Let the palm oil bobble for sometime and pour it onto the boiling yam and other ingredients in the other pot.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Stir everything to get a fine mixture and off the heat under the pan.
                    </li>
                    <li>Remove from heat and let it sit for about 5 minutes before serving.</li>
                    <li>
