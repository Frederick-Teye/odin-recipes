                <h2>Origin, Looks and More About Banku</h2>
                <p>
                    Banku is a popular Ghanaian dish that is enjoyed in both Ghana and Nigeria. It is made with fermented corn dough and
                    cassava dough, and is typically eaten with soup or stew.

                <p>
                    The origin of banku is not clear. However, it is believed to have originated from the Ga-Adangme people along the
                    southeastern coast of Ghana. The dish has since spread to other parts of West Africa and has become a staple in many
                    households.

                <h3>Instructions</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        In a bowl, mix the corn and cassava dough (banku mix) with water. Start with about 1 cup of water, and gradually add
                        more as needed. The dough should be smooth and elastic. Knead it thoroughly to remove any lumps.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Transfer the dough to a saucepan or cooking pot and place it on the stovetop.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Cook the dough over medium heat, stirring continuously with a wooden paddle or ladle. It should thicken as it cooks.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Continue to cook and stir until the banku is smooth, stretchy, and has a slightly sour taste. This can take about 20-30
                        minutes. Be patient and ensure the dough is well-cooked.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Once the banku is cooked, remove it from the heat. Wet your hands with cold water to prevent sticking, and shape the
                        banku into small, round balls or oval shapes.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Banku is typically served with a variety of soups or stews, such as light soup, groundnut soup, palm nut soup, or okra
                        soup. It's common to serve it with grilled or fried fish, meat, or vegetables, and a side of hot pepper sauce (shito).
